# Parabeac Counter App

This repo is designed to show how to make the sample Flutter Counter App with code generation from [Parabeac-Core](https://github.com/Parabeac/Parabeac-Core).

## Getting Started

Before trying to understand how this project works, be sure you are already aware of the following technologies:
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
* [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
* [Parabeac-Core](https://github.com/Parabeac/Parabeac-Core)

![Code Integration Concept](https://github.com/parabeac/parabeac_generated_counter_app/blob/main/code_integration_concept.jpeg?raw=true)

The main thing to understand with using Parabeac generated code is that static UI code should be owned by the designer, business logic and state management should be owned by the developer. Parabeac prints these out in .g files. However, Parabeac also generates non .g widget files when there should be one and it doesn't exist. This happens when a UI component should contain some functionality that is impossible to determine from an interpretation of a design file. To do this, in your design program you must label a UI group or element as `<custom>`. This generates the boilerplate needed to add functionality. Once this non .g file is generated or exists, it will never be re-generated from Parabeac.

Let's take a look at this project example. In this project you will find the following files that were gerenated from Parabeac-Core.
### .g files
* my_app_screen.g.dart
* counter_value_text.g.dart
* responsive_orientation_builder.g.dart *For this example we will ignore this file*
### Normal dart files - *NOTE: While these were generated, they now include developer changes.*
* counter_button.dart
* counter_value_holder.dart

### Normal dart files not generated by Parabeac
* counter_cubit.dart
* main.dart

# Code Review
We will now go over each file and touch on what's going on here.
## my_app_screen.g.dart
This screen contains references to counter_button.dart & counter_value_holder.dart, these references were generated by a designer calling the UI elements `<custom>`.
This screen also contains a reference to counter_value_text.g.dart. You'll notice as we dig through the files that this reference won't be used, but it's useful that the UI component itself was seperated into it's own component to be reused anywhere in the codebase. We'll specifically revisit this in counter_value_holder.dart

## counter_value_text.g.dart
This component was generated because there is a shared element (component/symbol) in the design file. This is powerful because it be used by both existing .g files & by any of the developer written files.

## counter_cubit.dart
This is the first non-generated dart file that we, the developer created. It's a simple cubit designed to hold the state value and have a function to increment it.
## main.dart
This is the main dart file for the Flutter project. It contains the MyAppScreen widget & it's wrapped in our CounterCubit for children widgets to utilize.
## counter_button.dart
This is the first generated but non .g file that we are going over. Originally, this widget is printed out in the build method as the following:

```
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return widget.child;
  }
```

Because this widget is supposed to be a button, we wrap it in a `GestureDetector()`. In our `onTap()` we call the `increment()` function from the CounterCubit. We don't change the visual output of this button, we just wrap `widget.child`.

## counter_value_holder.dart
This is another widget that was originally generated by Parabeac but was then edited by Parabeac. In this case, unlike the `CounterButton()` we don't reutilize `widget.child` because we need to override this code. Luckily, because we seperated the UI that was going to be placed here in a shared element (Component/Symbol), we can still utilize this in a reusable way.

Rather than returning `widget.child` we return similar code to what's written in the original my_app_screen.g.dart file. First, a `LayoutBuilder()` because components sizing needs to be based on a relative (Eddie please confirm here) context. Then as the child of the `LayoutBuilder()` a `CounterValueText()` except rather then setting a default value like '0', we provide it the value from the `CounterCubit`. This now allows designers to change the look of the CounterValueText component and have it reflected through the use of Parabeac without breaking developer logic.
